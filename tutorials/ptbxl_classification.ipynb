    "\n",
    "[PTB-XL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0495-6) is a large publicly available electrocardiography (ECG) dataset. It comprises of 21,837 12-lead, 10 seconds long ECG recordings collected from 18,885 patients. The ECG-waveform data was annotated by two cardiologists as a multi-label dataset, where diagnostic labels were further aggregated into super and subclasses. In this notebook, we will classify each 10 second ECG recording into one of 5 SCP ECG classes: (1) Normal ECG, (2) Conduction Disturbance, (3) Myocardial Infarction, (4) Hypertrophy, and (5) ST/T change.

    "## 2. Loading MOMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first install the MOMENT package, load some essential packages and the pre-trained model. \n",
    "\n",
    "MOMENT can be loaded in 4 modes: (1) `reconstruction`, (2) `embedding`, (3) `forecasting`, and (4) `classification`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `reconstruction` mode, MOMENT reconstructs input time series, potentially containing missing values. We can solve imputation and anomaly detection problems in this mode. This mode is suitable for solving imputation and anomaly detection tasks. During pre-training, MOMENT is trained to predict the missing values within uniformly randomly masked patches (disjoint sub-sequences) of the input time series, leveraging information from observed data in other patches. As a result, MOMENT comes equipped with a pre-trained reconstruction head, enabling it to address imputation and anomaly detection challenges in a zero-shot manner! Check out the `anomaly_detection.ipynb` and `imputation.ipynb` notebooks for more details!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `embedding` model, MOMENT learns a $d$-dimensional embedding (e.g., $d=1024$ for `MOMENT-1-large`) for each input time series. These embeddings can be used for clustering and classification. MOMENT can learn embeddings in a zero-shot setting! Check out `classification.ipynb` notebook for more details! \n",
    "\n",
    "The `forecasting` and `classification` modes are used for forecasting and classification tasks, respectively. In these modes, MOMENT learns representations which are subsequently mapped to the forecast horizon or the number of classes, using linear forecasting and classification heads. Both the forecasting and classification head are randomly initialized, and therefore must be fine-tuned before use. Check out the `forecasting.ipynb` notebook for more details!"
